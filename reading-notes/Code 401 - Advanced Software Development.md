# Reading Notes in Java
- Details below are bullet points for a fullstack class in Java.
## Relational DataBase
- From practicing the Database, I can see that R is similar to SQL Bolt in that grabbing information. The comparison is similar but not the same, but for my understanding, I see the resemblence and can be useful to understand how things are ordered in a database and its limitations from knowing a little bit about R.

## Reading Notes 1
1. Variables: these are the primitive types such as int, long, double, char, ... Further, there are arrays and Strings we may utilize in Java. 
2. Operators: logical operators (!, ?=, ==,  <,>, <=, >=), instance of are a few of the operators we may use.
3. an Expression is like a sentence in grammer. you must specify keywords and logic to create a sentence. 
4. the Control Flow can change the flow of reading a program by using inheritence , looping, and/or logic 
5. A compiler is a tool that is used to check for errors such as syntax and any throws needed. it also integrates the libraries(dependencies) needed along with unwinding the stack. Machine language kicks off(linux uses ARM/ASM or depends on distro).
